# Solving Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem using Genetic Algorithm

This repository contains the source code to solve the Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach. The code is developed in C++ and was created using Visual Studio.

## Introduction

The Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem is a classic optimization problem where the objective is to find the best schedule for a set of tasks given a limited set of resources. This project aims to tackle this problem using Genetic Algorithms, which are a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection.

## Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (preferably from Visual Studio)
- Visual Studio IDE (or any compatible IDE or editor)

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-link](https://github.com/shadzzz90/RCPSP-Genetic-Algorithm)
   ```

2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.

3. Build the project.

4. Run the executable or debug within the IDE.



## Features

- Implementation of Genetic Algorithm for RCPSP.
